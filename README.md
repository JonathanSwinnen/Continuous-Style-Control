<h2>About</h2>

Unlike text-conditioned models like Stable Diffusion, common unconditional
GANs such as StyleGAN allow for style control of the generated images by manipulating
the input latent code. It is possible to discover latent directions that
correlate with certain characteristics, such as hair color, skin tone, lighting, and
pose (in the particular example of faces). Since the latent space is continuous, it
is also possible to smoothly interpolate between these factors of variation while
preserving the identity of the generated image. It would be interesting to see if
such interpolation can also be achieved using diffusion models.
<br><br>
Our attempt to achieve this uses a combination of CLIP embedding interpolation and attention map interpolation (based on <a href="https://prompt-to-prompt.github.io/">Prompt-to-Prompt</a>).
We also tried comparing it to another technique based on <a href="https://github.com/ml-research/semantic-image-editing">Semantic Guidance</a>. These methods are then used to interpolate between text prompts, which allows continuous style control (eg. between prompts like "a red car" and "a green car"), but also more complex morphs (eg. "a squirrel eating a burger" and "a lion eating a burger").
<br><br>
Our findings are described in our [final report](report.pdf).

<h2>Try it out yourself</h2>

To experiment with our code and see how it works, you can take a look at the Jupyter Notebook. The [CSC-all-in-one.ipynb](CSC-all-in-one.ipynb) notebook can simply be uploaded to Google Colab and should just work without any extra setup. You can also find this notebook <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TU4SkCyWEjO-nZOs4q4PW0FDy_TrRstK?usp=sharing">here</a>. To run our main interpolation method (AttentionFullInterpolation) locally, a GPU with 16GB+ VRAM is required.
